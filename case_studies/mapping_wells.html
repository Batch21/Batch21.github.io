      	<p>The impacts of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/india-drought-affecting-330-million-people-weak-monsoons">recent drought</a> that effected large parts of western and southern India were so severe that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/First-train-carrying-five-lakh-litres-of-water-reaches-drought-hit-Latur/articleshow/51787639.cms">trains were used to transport water to the worst hit regions</a>. Although this yearâ€™s monsoon has produced above average rainfall <a href="http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/in-june-7-drought-hit-states-short-of-water-67340?utm_content=buffer27917&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"> for some areas</a>, climate change is expected to increase the severity of droughts in the future, heightening the already extreme pressure that rural water supplies are under in many parts of rural India . </p>
      	<p>Aquifers have become the predominant source of water for both agricultural and domestic use across much of southern India, both due to increasing demand and the limited and seasonal nature of surface water resources. The increase in groundwater use has been driven by improvements in borewell technology, decreases in borewell construction costs, and government subsidies that reduce running costs. It has led to a large expansion of the area of land under irrigation and the area which are double-cropped. Groundwater, along with increased fertiliser and pesticide use and the adoption of new crop varieties, has therefore greatly increased agricultural productivity, boosted rural prosperity and has helped to significantly reduce poverty levels across rural India. </p>
      	<p>However, subsidised and unregulated use of groundwater has also led to precipitous declines in groundwater levels in many regions (World Bank, 2010). To maintain access to water in these areas, farmers have had to dig increasing numbers of ever deeper borewells. Poor farmers, often from lower social groups, have been less able to do this than richer farmers and have therefore seen their access to water curtailed. Well failure and a subsequent inability to repay loans taken out for well construction has been stated as a primary cause of the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/india-thousands-of-farmer-suicides-prompt-1bn-crop-insurance-scheme"> high suicide rates of farmers in rural India</a>.</p>

        <p>Falling groundwater levels have also increased pressure of domestic water supplies as many traditional drinking water sources have fallen dry. The impact has been exacerbated by an increasing demand for water due to population growth and rising incomes. Many households still do not receive the 40 of clean water litres per capita per day recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO, 1998), resulting in significant social, economic and health related problems, which are felt disproportionally by the poor (Hunter, P., et al., 2010).</p>
      	<p>The revenue village is located in Kurnool district within the state of Andhra Pradesh, a few miles west of the town of Dhone. The revenue village has an area of 25.4 km2 and consist of 4 individual villages that, in 2012, had a total of 1087 households. The region is semi-arid with an average annual rainfall of 587mm. Soil in the revenue village is predominantly inceptisols with small areas of entisols and alfsols.  The underlying geology is crystalline basement. The average elevation of the revenue village is 430 metres, with a maximum of 533 metres and a minimum of 385 metres. However, the hills that rise a short distance beyond the revenue village boundary rise to a maximum elevation of 620 metres. Single crop agriculture accounts for 60% and double-crop agriculture 8% of the total area of the revenue village, although these figures vary significantly depending on annual rainfall. Other important land uses included plantations, primarily mango, which account for 11% of the area, and scrub forest, which accounts for 11% of the area.</p>

      	<p>Decision-making in semi-arid rural India is complicate by the fact that different stakeholders have a range of different agricultural, social, economic and environmental goals (Kaur et al, 2003). A further complication is that for many catchments the quantity and location of water infrastructure, including wells and RWH structures, is unknown, which make the effective planning of future interventions difficult. One solution is to use GPS technology and GIS software to map and analyse the location of infrastructure. Mapping can be done using standalone GPS devices, however increasingly smartphone apps, such as Akvo Flow and mWater, are used. These apps have been used by a wide range of projects to map hundreds of thousands of water points worldwide (link: https://www.waterpointdata.org/), however for this project traditional handheld GPS devices were used, with 4 local students primarily responsible for collecting the data. For each well and RWH structure mapped a range of information was collected including type, cost, year of construction, and current status. Additionally, every household in all 4 of the villages was survey to collect a range of socio-economic and WASH information. The visualisation below presents the wells located in revenue village and demonstrates how their number and characteristics change over time.</p>

    	 <p>The most dramatic trend show by the visualisation above is the rapid increase in the number of wells, particularly since the turn of the century. In 1980 there were 86 wells in the revenue village at an average density of 3.4 per km2. By 2012 the number of wells had increased to 573 at a density of 22.6 per km2. However, this does not tell the whole story, as the lack of wells between Lakshmipalli, the northernmost village, and the other three villages is due to much of this land being bought by residents of Dhone town. As the wells were mapped by consulting famers from each of the four villages, many of the wells in this area were missed by the survey and it is therefore very likely that the density of wells in the revenue village is even higher than the well survey data shows. </p>
    	 <p>Not only has the number of wells increased dramatically since 1985, the rate of increase has also accelerated. Between 1990 and 2000, the average number of wells constructed each year was 8.5, between 2000 and 2006 this rose to 22.7 wells per year, and between 2006 and 2012 to 39 per year. This rapid increase in well numbers resulted both from an expansion of the irrigated area and the failure of many older and shallower wells, due to falling groundwater levels.  </p>
    	 <p>Falling groundwater levels are by the increasing depth of the wells constructed. The mean depth of wells constructed before 1985 was 9.8 metres, between 1985 and 2000 it was 43.4 metres, between 2000 and 2006 it was 50.7 metres, and between 2006 and 2012 it was 65 metres. This trend is also shown by changes in the type of wells constructed over time. Of the 86 wells built before 1985 only 3 were borewells â€“ two for domestic use and one agricultural.  Between 1985 and 2000, 48% of new wells were borewells, between 2000 and 2006 this proportion rose to 69%, and between 2006 and 2012 to 88%. Interestingly the average depth of the 172 agricultural borewells constructed between 2006 and 2012 was 67.7 metres, in comparison to 93.1 for the 49 domestic borewells constructed in the same period. This could indicate the prioritisation of domestic supplies over agricultural supplies and shows the extensive measure that needed to be taken to secure drinking water supplies. Of the 49 domestic borewell constructed between 2006 and 2012, 8 have failed completely, including 3 that were over 100 metres deep. </p>
    	 <p>In 2012, 23% of the mapped wells were defunct, 19% failed every summer, 10% failed only during droughts, and 46% had never failed. It was not just shallower open wells that failed â€“ a significant number of wells more than 50 metres deep had failed. On the other hand, some open wells, less than 5 metres deep have never failed, highlighting the spatial variability of groundwater. It can often be difficult to successful located a deep borewell due to lack of information about local geology, whereas a well sited open well can provide reliable supply, especially if supported by RWH.</p>
