        <h3 class="chapter chap-1">1. Introduction</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="chapter-1"></a>
        <p>In recent decades, water scarcity has worsened over large areas of India as a result of demand for water outstripping sustainable supply.  Underlying causes for this include: population growth, a growing economy, land use change, urbanisation and intensification of rainfed and irrigated agriculture.  The risk exists that water scarcity is or will be exacerbated the impact of climate change on annual and seasonal rainfall and the frequency and severity of extreme events, such as floods and droughts.</p>
        <p>A major consequence of the above is a reduction in the water security of many water users and uses and, more specifically, the ability of water users to cope effectively with water scarcity.  At an institutional level, India has various programmes in place to mitigate the impacts of drought, but these did not prevent more than 25% of Indiaâ€™s population being affected by the <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Over-25-of-Indias-population-hit-by-drought-Centre-tells-Supreme-Court/articleshow/51901956.cms">recent pre-monsoon drought in 2016</a></p>
      	<p>Aquifers have become the primary source of water for both agricultural and domestic use across much of India, both due to increasing demand and the limited and seasonal nature of surface water resources. The increase in groundwater use has also been driven by improvements in well technology, decreases in construction costs, and government subsidies for electricity and diesel fuel. One result has been a large expansion of the area of land under irrigation, which, along with other agricultural advances such as increased fertiliser and pesticide use and the adoption of new crop varieties, has improved agricultural productivity and profitability</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/borewell-large.jpg" alt="Borewell irrigation" title="Borewell irrigation near to Ungaranigundla village">
        <p>However, subsidised and unregulated use of groundwater has led to a steady decline in groundwater levels in many regions and the widespread failure of wells<sup>1</sup>. To maintain access to water, farmers have had to construct increasing numbers of ever deeper borewells. Poorer farmers, often from lower social/caste groups, are generally less able to do so and have therefore seen their access to water curtailed. Well failure and a subsequent inability to repay construction loans has been cited as a primary cause of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/india-thousands-of-farmer-suicides-prompt-1bn-crop-insurance-scheme">high suicide rates of farmers in rural India</a> and a factor in driving migration from the rural to urban areas. </p>
        <p>Falling groundwater levels have also increased pressure on domestic water supplies as many traditional drinking water sources can no longer be relied upon.  As stated above, increasing demand for water due to population growth and rising incomes is also a factor. Many rural households do not receive the minimum 40 litres per capita per day of clean water recommended by the Government of India and the World Health Organisation, which results in significant social, economic and health related problems<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <h3 class="chapter chap-2">2. Study Overview</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="chapter-2"></a>
        <p><a href="http://www.ircwash.org/washcost">The WASHCost project</a>, funded by the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, worked in India, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mozambique during 2008-2012 on the theoretical and actual costs of sustainable, equitable and efficient Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services provision. In India this involved collecting and analysing data from a representative number of villages across Andhra Pradesh.</p>

        </div>
        <p>However, it became clear that WASH services levels were influenced significantly by factors that included: geographical location, agricultural water use, activities aimed at intensifying irrigated and rainfed agriculture, social status/caste and various political economy factors.  These preliminary findings prompted a detailed study of patterns of water accessibility, use and competition in one selected revenue village, a governmental and administration unit that typically comprises of a cluster of villages and hamlet, in southern Andhra Pradesh.</p>
        <p>The selected revenue village is located a few kilometres west of the town of Dhone in Kurnool district. It has an area of 25.4 km2 and consists of 4 individual villages that in 2012 had a total of 1087 households. Single crop agriculture accounts for approximately 60% and double-crop agriculture 8% of the total area of the revenue village.  However, these figures vary significantly depending on annual rainfall. Other important land uses included plantations, primarily mango, which account for 11% of the area, and scrub forest, which accounts for 11% of the area.  </p>
      	<p>The region is semi-arid, with an annual average rainfall 618 mm. The majority of this rainfall is contributed by the southwest monsoon, between June and September, and the northeast monsoon, between October and December. The varying strengths of the monsoons leads to large variations in annual and monthly rainfall totals.</p>
      	<div id="rainfall-vis">
          <ul id="rainfall-choices">
            <li class="rainfall-selection" id="rainfall-selection-left">Annual Rainfall</li>
            <li class="rainfall-selection">Monthly Rainfall</li>
            <li class="rainfall-selection" id="rainfall-selection-right">Daily Rainfall</li>
          </ul>
          <div id="rainfall-charts">
            <div id="rainfall-ann" ></div>
            <div id="rainfall-mon-box"></div>
            <div id="rainfall-daily" ></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>As can be seen in the daily rainfall visualisation above, a relatively small number of days with heavy rain account for a large proportion of annual rainfall. For example, 89.8 and 246.8 mm of rain fell on the 23rd and 24th June 2007 respectively. In total, these two days accounted for 66% of the monthly rainfall total and 23% of the annual rainfall total. More generally, of the 7450 mm of rain that occurred in the 11-year period between June 1997 and May 2008, 27% fell on days with 50 mm of rainfall or more.</p>
        <p>The geology of the revenue village is crystalline basement, which generally consists of fractured bedrock overlain by weathered material. Groundwater can be found both in this weathered material and in cracks and fissures in the bedrock. While borewells drilled into the bedrock can provide a reliable supply of water, they also frequently fail when dug in areas where the bedrock has few cracks and fissures<sup>3</sup>. As bedrock characteristics can vary significantly over short distances, successfully siting a borewell is a challenge. </p>
        <h3 class='chapter chap-3'>3. Data Collection</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="chapter-3"></a>
      	<p>Accessing and managing water resources in semi-arid rural India is complicated by a larger number of biophysical and societal factors and the fact that different stakeholders have a range of different agricultural, social, economic and environmental goals. A further complication is that for many catchments the quantity, location, ownership and status of water infrastructure, including wells and Rain Water Harvesting(RWH) structures, is unknown.  One solution is to use GPS technology and participatory approaches to map the location of infrastructure. Increasingly this is done using smartphone apps, such as <a href="http://akvo.org/products/akvoflow/">Akvo Flow</a> and <a href="http://www.mwater.co/">mWater</a>.</p>
        <p>For this study traditional handheld GPS devices were used due to their robustness and simplicity in comparison to smartphone options at the time. For each well and RWH structure located in the revenue village information was collected that included: type, cost, year of construction, ownership and current status. Most of the survey work was carried out by four students from the revenue village who were contracted by the study and supervised by a retired hydro-geologists from the state groundwater department. </p>

    	  </div>
    	  <p>The most dramatic trend show by the visualisation is the rapid increase in the number of wells, particularly since the turn of the century. In 1980 there were 86 wells in the revenue village at an average density of 3.4 per km2. By 2012 the had increase to 573 at a density of 22.6 per km2. Between 1990 and 2000, the average number of wells constructed each year was 8.5, this rose to 22.7 per year between 2000 and 2006, and 39 per year between 2006 and 2012. This acceleration in well construction resulted both from the profitability of irrigated cropping relative to rainfed cropping and the failure of older and shallower wells due to falling groundwater levels. </p>
    	  <p>The visualisation also shows that the increase in well numbers was coupled with an increase in the depth of the wells. The average depth of wells constructed prior to 1980 was 8.7 metres. This increased to 37 metres between 1980 and 2000, to 50.7 metres between 2000 and 2006, and finally to 64 metres between 2006 and 2012. Also notable is the change in the type of well being constructed.  Of all the wells constructed prior to the year 2000 only 32% were borewells, in comparison to 82% of the wells constructed between 2000 and 2012.  </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/open-well.jpg" alt="Borewell" title="Open well near to Lashmipalli village">
    	  <p>Interestingly the average depth of the 224 agricultural borewells constructed between 2000 and 2012 was 67.7 metres while the average depth of the 75 domestic borewells constructed in the same period was 88.5 metres. Of these domestic borewells, 12 with an average depth of 89.5 metres were defunct, 12 failed every summer and 5 during droughts. This gives some indication of the difficulties faced in achieving security of WASH services delivery in the context of falling groundwater levels. Much of the drinking water for Ungaranigundla, the southernmost village, is now sourced from 3 borewells, all over 100 metres deep, located 2 km south of the village and upstream of the majority of agricultural wells. </p>
    	  <p>It is clear from the well visualisation that failure has not just been a problem for shallow open wells. Of the 327 wells mapped in the revenue village that were more than 50 metres deep 38% had failed to some extent, including 26 wells over 100 metres deep. On the other hand, of the 198 wells that were mapped with depths of less than 10 metres, 20% had never failed and only 35% had completely failed. </p>
        <h3 class='chapter chap-5'>5. The Impact on WASH Services</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="chapter-5"></a> 
        <img src="/assets/images/domestic-borewell.jpg" alt="Borewell" title="Domestic Borwell in Ungaranigundla village" class="img-left">
        <p>In general, falling groundwater levels have impacted negatively on household water service levels in the revenue village. The survey data showed that 58% of households received less than 40 litres of water per capita per day during either or both of the summer or non-summer seasons. During the non-summer season households spent an average of 60 minutes per day collecting water. This rose to 95 minutes during the summer as some water sources became less reliable or failed completely.</p>
        <p>The impacts of water scarcity have not been felt evenly by all groups and individuals. The households with lower per capita water use and that spent more time collecting water were generally those that had lower income and land ownership than average and that were members of lower social/caste groups. Furthermore, within many households the tasks of collecting water fall disproportionately on women and children.</p>
        <h3 class='chapter chap-6'>6. Is Rain Water Harvesting the Solution?</h3>
        <a class="anchor" id="chapter-6"></a>
        <p>The primary solution to groundwater depletion in India has been the construction of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) structures that capture surface runoff and improve localised groundwater recharge. Other recorded benefits include the attenuation of downstream flood peaks and reducing sedimentation of downstream reservoirs. </p>
        <p>Many RWH structures in rural areas of India have been funded and build by the governmentâ€™s watershed development programmes. Since the 1980s, these programmes have invested billions of dollars but evidence of widespread benefits, in terms of improving water security, is relatively scarce. This is partly because measuring the impact of RWH structures, in terms of increasing groundwater recharge, at local scales is a challenging and time-consuming task<sup>4</sup>. Nevertheless, RWH structures are seen as essential tool for improving groundwater sustainability and if well designed and sited can have significant local benefits<sup>5</sup>.</p>
        <p>In many areas, local NGOs and community groups have been influential in promoting RWH and other conservation measures, such as reforestation. One of the best known NGOs is the <a href="http://tarunbharatsangh.in/">Tarun Bharat Singh</a> organisation which has helped to rejuvenate the Arvari catchment in Rajastan through the promotion of RWH and the formation of a river parliament through which 72 villages could communally manage the catchmentâ€™s water resources. Another is the <a href="http://www.timbaktu.org/">Timbuktu collective</a> which has undertaken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0Wp-5Mjs7Y">similar work</a> in Anatapur district in southern Andhra Pradesh.</p>

      <p>In total 55 check dams, 42 infiltration tank, and 6 bunds have been constructed in the revenue village by various agencies at a total cost of around $55,000. The majority have been built during the last two decades and mostly in years when government projects focused on the area. The total capacity of all the RWH structures that have not been destroyed is approximately 114,000 m3, which is equivalent to approximately 4mm of rainfall spread evenly across the catchment. However, as mentioned earlier, a large proportion of rainfall occurs on days of heavy rainfall, which limits how much water can be captured by the structures.</p>
      <p>Overall, the success of RWH has been mixed, with 65% of the structures destroyed or damaged. In some cases, floods have been the cause, but many structures have been purposely damaged or destroyed by farmers to allow more runoff to flow downstream. Another issue is siltation, which has significantly reduced the capacity of some of the older structures. This suggests that the structures need to be better support by other sustainable land management techniques, such as the reforestation of the surrounding hills. On the positive side, the RWH structure with the largest capacity in the revenue village is a bund that plays an important role in maintaining the reliability of the 3 borewells that supply the majority of drinking water to the village of Ungaranigundla. </p>
      <img src="/assets/images/check-dam.jpg" alt="Borewell" title="Damaged check dam near to Lakshmipalli village">

      <p>The effectiveness of RWH structures depends heavily on local factors, particularly the efficiency of groundwater recharge, the storage capacity of the underlying aquifers, and the dynamic interactions between surface water and groundwater<sup>6</sup>. However, these factors are often ignored in the planning of watershed interventions, as is the fact that by reducing downstream flows, intensive RWH harvesting can increase inequality in catchments in terms of access to water. This can be seen in the revenue village by the fact that farmers have purposely damaging RWH structures to release runoff downstream. Furthermore, the impact on downstream flows is normally greatest during droughts when demand for water is highest.</p>
      <p>Some studies have shown that nearly all surface runoff within a catctment can be captured if RWH is intensive enough<sup>7</sup>. As conflict between states over the sharing of water resources is already <a href="http://scroll.in/article/810416/the-water-wars-between-telangana-and-andhra-refuse-to-die-down-but-can-anyone-really-win">increasing in the region</a>, the impact of increased RWH as well as climate change could further inflame the situation.</p>
      <h3 class='chapter chap-7'>7. Conclusion</h3>
      <a class="anchor" id="chapter-7"></a>
      <p>More equitable sharing of water resources both within the revenue village and downstream requires increased focus on demand management, especially as new technology, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOnhwuOnWLg">solar pumps</a>, could lead to the further overexploitation of groundwater. While RWH has an important role to play, it needs to be carefully planned so as to avoid significant downstream externalities. In this regard, leveraging new technology, such as smartphones, to map and collect information about structures can play an important role, especially as, as has been demonstrated above, advances in web technologies allow for better visualisation and communication of such data.  Advances in remote sensing and the use of drones provide further sources of useful data. </p>
      <p>More equitable sharing of water resources inevitably requires trade-offs and compromises, however there are an increasing number of examples, such as the Arvari catchment, that demonstration that community management can help achieve this goal and reduce the impacts of water scarcity on rural communities in India.</p>
