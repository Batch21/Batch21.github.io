Hi, I’m James Batchelor – a hydrologist who specialises in GIS and hydrological modelling. 

Over the past few years, I’ve become increasingly interested in the use of interactive web-based visualisation techniques as a way to explore and communicate data. A primary motivation for developing this website is to revisit some of the data collected by recent projects I’ve worked on and create some better visualisations. 

If you are interested in my work, I can be contacted via <a href="mailto:jamesbatchelor@outlook.com">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Aqua_Vis">Twitter</a>.
