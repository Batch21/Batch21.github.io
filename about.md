Hi, I’m James Batchelor – a hydrologist who specialises in GIS and hydrological modelling. 

Over the past few years, I’ve become increasingly interested in the use of interactive web-based visualisation techniques as a way to explore and communicate data. A primary motivation for developing this website is to revisit some of the data collected by recent projects I’ve worked on and create some better visualisations. 

So far I have <a href="../case-studies/visualising-water-scarcity.html">visualised data</a> collected by the <a href="http://www.ircwash.org/washcost">WASHCost project</a> to illustrate increasing water scarcity in a rural area of India.  Over the coming months I plan to add a couple more case studies. One will use data from the <a href="http://www.fao.org/in-action/kagera/home/en/">Kagera TAMP project</a> to investigate the impacts of sustainable land management on the hydrology of the Kagera Basin in central Africa. A second will use outputs from a hydrological model, setup for a <a href="http://www.profor.info/knowledge/institutional-analysis-and-landscape-level-planning-guidelines-watershed-development-india">World Bank pilot project</a> in Gujarat, to explore the potential impacts of watershed development on an agricultural catchment. I also plan to add <a href="../blog/index.html">blog</a> posts that describe the development of the visualisations and explore sources of inspiration and related work. 

If you are interested in my work, I can be contacted via <a href="mailto:jamesbatchelor@outlook.com">email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Aqua_Vis">Twitter</a>.
