<div class="container">
 <p class="vis-example-text">The graph below shows rainfall intensity for a large rainfall event recorded on the 1<sup>st</sup> May 2015 in the Yanze catchment, Rwanda. The data was collected by the <a href="http://www.fao.org/in-action/kagera/home/en/">Kagera TAMP project</a>  using a tipping-bucket rain gauge, which recorded the time of every 0.2 mm of rain. Rainfall intensity is normally measured in millimetres per hour (mm/h) over a given duration â€“  most commonly 5 minutes. The graph demonstrates how varying this duration dramatically changes the calculated intensities.</p>
